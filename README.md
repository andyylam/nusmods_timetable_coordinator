# NUSMODS Timetable Coordinator

This was written on a whim to try to coordinate lunch timings between my friends in NUS! Currently, completely unrefined and untested code because it was written as quickly as possible. It takes in any number of nusmods timetable URLs and returns, from Monday to Friday, timings where you and your friends don't have classes so you can have meals together!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- The latest version of Python

### Getting started

    1.  cd into the directory and run `python main.py` in your terminal
    2.  Input the NUSMODS URLs of you and your friends timetables. Input 'x' to stop.
    3.  Obtain results!
